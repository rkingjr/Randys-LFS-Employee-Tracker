# Homework 12: Randy's LFS Employee Tracker

## Description:

The purpose of this application si to provide management system for employees within a company. This application will allow you to view all employees, by department, or manager. You may also add new roles along with their salaries and respective department. You may also add new employees, add them to a department, and assign a role. Lastly, you can delete the department, role, or employee.

When creating my own example of this application, I drew upon my experience as the Center Education Manager of LFS Center for EF English First in Chengdu, China. Rather than using departments, I used units, workers instead of employees (Communist China and all), and positions instead of roles. The seed file uses people I worked with in their respective positions.
